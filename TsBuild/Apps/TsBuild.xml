 The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the 
 root of a TypeScript project. The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the 
 compiler options required to compile the project. A project is compiled in one of the 
 following ways:

 #### Using tsconfig.json
 
 1. By invoking tsc With no input files, In which Case the compiler searches For the 
    tsconfig.json file starting In the current directory And continuing up the parent 
    directory chain.
 2. By invoking tsc With no input files And a --project (Or just -p) command line Option 
    that specifies the path Of a directory containing a tsconfig.json file, Or a path To 
    a valid .json file containing the configurations.
    
 When input files are specified on the command line, tsconfig.json files are ignored.
